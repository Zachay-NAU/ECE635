# ECE635-Home safety system using LLM Agents

## Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have become extremely popular due to their reasoning capabilities. LLM agents are autonomous systems that combine the power of standalone LLMs and tools such as search, weather, calculator, etc to handle more complex tasks and queries.
## Goal
Use LLM agents to design a home safety system.
## Deliverables:
‚ó¶ Understand LLM agents. (tutorial provided)
 
‚ó¶ Implement basic LLM agents using the tutorials.

‚ó¶ Use LLM agents to design a home safety system. It could be anything. E.g., intruder detection, smoke/fire in the kitchen, stray animal detection etc. Be creative. The point here is that you should let the LLM do the reasoning and designing of the system. You should just equip the LLM with the necessary tools to be able to reason. The references and tutorials will help you build such a system.

‚ó¶ The final output of the LLM should be some code snippet. E.g., in the case of fire detection, it should output code to train some object detection model on kitchen fire images.

## Motivation
With the rapid advancement of technology and the widespread adoption of IoT devices, smart homes are becoming more common. However, home security remains a critical concern. Risks such as fires, intrusions, and other emergencies continue to pose threats to homeowners. There is a strong need for an integrated home safety system that can actively monitor and provide real-time alerts to enhance home security.

The integration of Large Language Models (LLM) as intelligent agents in a home safety system offers a promising solution. LLM agents possess powerful natural language processing and data analysis capabilities, enabling them to understand and respond to data from multiple sensors and devices. This can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of home security systems by detecting threats such as fires, intrusions, and other emergencies in real time.

Key motivations for developing this system include:

### 1. Enhanced Intelligence and Automation
Traditional systems often rely on basic sensors, which may only detect specific types of threats. LLM agents can analyze and interpret data from multiple sources, reducing false alarms and offering more intelligent, automated responses to various security risks.

### 2. Improved Real-Time Risk Detection
LLM agents can monitor a wide range of risks, such as smoke, gas leaks, and break-ins. By processing sensor data and identifying patterns, the system can provide accurate alerts and learn from past events to continually improve its risk detection.

### 3. Convenience through Natural Language Interaction
Users can interact with the system via voice or mobile apps. In case of an emergency, the system will send alerts through various communication channels (e.g., SMS, calls), providing clear guidance on what actions to take.

### 4. Integration of External Information for Comprehensive Protection
The system can incorporate external data sources, such as local weather updates, fire warnings, and law enforcement alerts, to provide a broader security perspective and better anticipate potential threats.

### 5. Cost Reduction and Accessibility
By leveraging LLM technology, the system can be built on existing IoT infrastructure, reducing the need for expensive hardware. This makes advanced home security more affordable and accessible to a wider audience.
