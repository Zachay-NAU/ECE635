# ECE635-Home safety system using LLM Agents

## Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have become extremely popular due to their reasoning capabilities. LLM agents are autonomous systems that combine the power of standalone LLMs and tools such as search, weather, calculator, etc to handle more complex tasks and queries.
## Goal
Use LLM agents to design a home safety system.
## Deliverables:
◦ Understand LLM agents. (tutorial provided)
◦ Implement basic LLM agents using the tutorials.
◦ Use LLM agents to design a home safety system. It could be anything. E.g., intruder detection, smoke/fire in the kitchen, stray animal detection etc. Be creative. The point here is that you should let the LLM do the reasoning and designing of the system. You should just equip the LLM with the
necessary tools to be able to reason. The references and tutorials will help you build such a system.
◦ The final output of the LLM should be some code snippet. E.g., in the case of fire detection, it should output code to train some object detection model on kitchen fire images.
